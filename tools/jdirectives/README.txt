Joel's Special Restructured Text Directives
===========================================

Yes, the "j" stands for Joel. How boringly egocentric. In fairness, these largely predate Hackbright,
and It Seemed Like a Good Idea Five Years Ago.

graphviz
    My nicer Graphviz extension, which adds builder-specific sizing and autosizing.

incremental
    Helper classes for putting classes in for RevealJS "fragments" --- like incrementally-appearing
    bullet lists.

interslide
    Make interstitial graphical slides without titles. Typically used for silly cat photos :).

newslide
    Add a new slide, but not a new section for handouts.

noplot
    A noop so that people without matplotlib won't have their laptops burst into flames.

speakernote.py
    Add speakernotes to revealjs for the speaker note view
