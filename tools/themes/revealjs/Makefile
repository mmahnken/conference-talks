# Turn a pristine copy of revealjs into the version we use
#
# Reveal.js ships with a lot of test files, optional plug-ins, fonts, etc.
# Having all of our lectures include and upload this wastes space and time,
# since we don't reference those files anyway.
#
# To use:
#
# The "revealjs" directory in the same place as this Makefile should be the
# pristine-from-GitHub revealjs directory. Run "make theme" and it will
# make the version in static/revealjs with only the files we need.
